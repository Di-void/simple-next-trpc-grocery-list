# T3 GROCERY LIST APP WITH tRPC v10

This a changelog kinda docs for the project I found at [Francisco Mendes's own implementation](https://github.com/FranciscoMendes10866/next-tailwind-trpc-prisma)

I'm a bit late in geting in tRPC so when I was ready to learn it, I met the v10. I couldn't understand anything.

So it happened that as I was looking for a [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs) based project, I stumbled upon a [DEV](https://dev.to/) blog by [Francisco Mendes](https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/build-a-full-stack-app-with-nextjs-tailwind-trpc-and-prisma-orm-4ail) about a full-stack project that included the [T3](https://create.t3.gg/) stack. I rushed at it. But what I was seeing in the docs was very different from what was in Francisco Mendes's blog TUT(Tutorial). And I didn't seem to find a way to specifically install v9 of tRPC.

I ignored the differences and tried to replicate the code but, there were errors popping out everywhere. I was getting impatient. It was then I decided to take the time to study the tRPC v10 docs and differences between the previous version i.e v9. I used one of the [starter apps](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-starter) they provided on the website and started matching and I was finally able to make a break through.

It is the exact same project at **Francisco Mendes's** repo but with tRPC v10 implemented and some code comments too. Feel free to fork the repo or use it at a starting point if you're like me (emoji).
